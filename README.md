# GoReddit

GoReddit makes it easy to get some things done in reddit that would otherwise be time consuming.
It uses a Go wrapper for the Reddit API to subscribe to subreddits based on input. You can see all your subreddits here:
https://reddit.com/subreddits/mine

Currently, its very simple, and was made quickly to solve a problem. Could be expanded to do more things, become a CLI, etc.

Follow quick guide to get setup up with developer reddit credentials:

So far it can:
- Subscribe to a subreddit
- See metadata of a subreddit
- See top posts of a subreddit
